# Samurai-Rendition
My first game: Samurai Rendition

PFAQ's
1. The Continue on the home screen does NOT resume the game from the checkpoint. 
   It simply allows you to start from level 2 IF you completed level 1 and reached level 2.
2. Clicking the New Game button will load level 1. If you previously completed level 1 and reached level 2 and you
   press New Game, it will erase the saved data and the next time you press Continue, it will load level 1 and not level 2.
3. Checkpoints are only recorded while you're playing the level. Their purpose is to respawn you ONLY IF you fall off the screen.
   As soon as you quit or die, the checkpoints will be lost.
4. Yes there are many bugs. I'm working on them. If you spot any, please let me know.
5. You can press esc to pause the game. Pressing q after pausing the game will allow you to quit the level.
6. Yes the game is wacky. But I had to cut corners because of lack of resources. Please ignore the little things. It is my first game after all.
7. ENJOY!
